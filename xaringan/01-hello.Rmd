# Overview

You'll use this document to build your first slide deck and render to HTML using the xaringan package `r emo::ji("tada")`.

You'll use this deck to introduce yourself to another workshop participant. The chunk of R code above called setup is very important- please do not delete that or the YAML header above it either.

Since this will be HTML, comments like <!--this is a comment--> won't render in your final output.

# Get started

+ This is an R Markdown document. The current output format is specified in the YAML above as html_document. 

+ To make this document into a slide deck, update the output in the YAML to xaringan::moon_reader, instead of html_document.

+ Save the current document.

+ Click the **Knit** button. Your slides might show up in your RStudio Viewer Pane, or as a separate window. 
  + If in the viewer pane, click on the window looking button to the right of the broom icon to see your slides in your normal browser.
  + If in a separate window, try clicking on the **Open in Browser** button to see in a larger window.
  
+ Do you see two slides? If you do, look up and smile at Alison right now.

# Activate moon_reader

+ Two ways to do this: 

  + either use the RStudio Add-in and select Infinite Moon Reader (under XARINGAN)

  + or in your console type xaringan::infinite_moon_reader

+ Again, open the rendered slides in a browser window. Now anytime you make changes to your .Rmd file and click **save**, xaringan will automatically regenerate your slides (you may need to click refresh in your browser).

+ Insert your own name into the YAML title, and click **save**.

+ Did your slides update with your name now on the title slide? If so, loop up and give Alison a thumbs up right now.

<!-- now delete everything, including this message, up to the bottom of that R setup code chunk. -->

# Introduce yourself! 

<!-- If you deleted everything above, this should be your first slide. I'll go first. -->

> My name is Alison and I am a Data Scientist & Professional Educator at RStudio. I live in Portland, Oregon with my husband, daughter, and our sourdough starter.

<!-- make this slide 2 with all content aligned to the right and middle. Personalize this! -->

<!-- make this slide 3 with incremental bullets -->

# Hi there 

My name is Alison

I like hot toddies

`#rdogladies`

and babies

<!-- make this slide 4 with a few online images -->

# Hi there, take 2

<!-- Insert an octocat image you identify with: https://octodex.github.com/ (right-click: copy image location) -->

# align individual lines




# two columns

<!-- make this 2 columns with text on left and code on right -->

My parents tell me that Alison with one "l" was more popular in the 80s- was it?

```{r}
# getting the data
alison_data <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Alison" | 
           name == "Allison") %>% 
  filter(sex == "F") 
```



# "Alison" vs. "Allison" popularity over time


```{r}
# pull this code to print left
alison_plot <- ggplot(
  alison_data, 
  aes(x = year, 
      y = prop,  
      group = name, 
      color = name)) + 
  geom_line() 
```


```{r echo = FALSE}
# pull this code to plot right
alison_plot
```
